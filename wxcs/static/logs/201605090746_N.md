##### 1. Key observations

1.1 Sat imagery showed deep convections over N'ern S China a/w the sfc trough.

1.2 Radarscope depicted scattered echoes developed over inland GD after 01H, about 150 km to our NW. The echoes were NE-moving and with lightning activities embedded. More echoes were seen by 07H over W'ern PRE, and the MAX also showed some weak echoes in our vicinity, likely triggered by the low-level confluence along the ridge.

1.3 12Z upper air sounding continued to show a dry mid level from 800 hPa to 400 hPa. CAPE and KI were respectively 2875 J/kg and 28.

1.4 Locally sfc winds were mod S'lies. Wind profiler suggested organized S'lies up to about 2000 m.

1.5 HKO Td stayed at about 25 C. HKO TT reached a min of 26.9 C at 0359H.

1.6 Visibility at SWH once fell below 500 m. Yet those reported at HKO/CLK were above 15 km.

##### 2. Meso-scale analysis and local considerations

2.1 WV channel depicted that an upper trough over NW China was moving SEwards. NWP suggested this 500/700 trough would deepen and sweep a/c C to S China today. The sfc trough and low-level shearline will strengthen over the inland areas and then be pushed towards the coast.

2.2 Latest models generally kept their story in which the sfc trough / low-level shearline will remain to our N by 18Z today, and the low-level ridging flow will continue to dominate over the S China coast. SP still expected during the day.

2.3 Although the 700 trough is yet to arrive, NWP indicated some shortwaves at 500 hPa ahead of the major W'ly trough will affect S China later today. WV also indicated a shortwave over SW China and the CMA radar showed more intense echoes over Guangxi/Guangdong boundary after 07H. Given that the low-level SW'lies jet will gradually strengthen, plus strong insolation during the day. The showery development over PRE is expected to be more significant than the past 2 days. "A few showers, and isolated TSTs later" was thus kept. Please closely monitor the development of the echoes to our W.

##### 3. Forecast issues

3.1      Re para 1.6; there were some coastal fog this morning. As the KI from 12Z sounding was not high, the boundary layer was likely a bit stable and thus fog can emerge under a Td/SST of 25.x C / 24 C. The coastal fog was not expected to persist upon insolation. As vis at SWH recovered to around 10 km and wx photos supported clearing of the fog patches, "coastal fog" was dropped at 0745H.

##### 4. Alternative scenario

4.1 The TT might reach 32 C this afternoon under abundant of sunshine and S'lies ahead of the trough.

4.2 Re para 1.2 and 2.3; the development zone this morning was much closer to the coast than that of yesterday. As the sfc trough migrates S'wards, the development zone would likely also edge towards the coast.  There might be more significant showers later this afternoon if the sfc trough moves faster, or the 500 shortwave is stronger than expected.
