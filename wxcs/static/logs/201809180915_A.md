##### 1. Key observations

1.1 Satellite imagery showed the large cloud system of SuperT Mangkhut covering SCS. It was generally clear over inland GD in the afternoon and the cloud bands a/w Mangkhut covered the territory in the evening.

1.2 Radarscope showed outer rain bands of Mangkhut affected E GD yet they largely weakened when moved W’wards before reaching PRE. IRIS workstation gave SG warning near E GD coast, about 200 km to our E.

1.3 Local sfc winds became NE’lies into the evening. Winds were strong on high ground, and picked up to gales by the end of this shift.

1.4 Wind profilers showed low-level NNE’lies strengthening after 16H, 50 kt winds were observed by 21H at about 2000 m.

1.5 HKO TT rose to 35.1C at 1407 C. Td lingered at 22-23 C.

1.6 Local vis improved in the afternoon.

1.7 GFS dropsondes generally supported the gale radius. The vertical wind profile indicated a very sharp slop in the boundary layer, hurricane was expected at 1000 m or below under the N’lies.

##### 2. Meso-scale analysis and local considerations

2.1 For TC Mangkhut, it moved WNW at about 10kt over the past 12hr. Satellite imagery showed a more organised inner eye appeared tonight. D’vorak analysis suggest CI=6.0 (bounded by weakening rule, FT=5.5). So its intensity was kept at 105 kt. The F6 radius were kept at 330 nm supported by sfc obs over N SCS. The F12 radius was reduced to 75 nm in view of the weaker structure comparing to that of yesterday based on sat imagery. Yet the F8 radius was enlarged to 225 nm at 12Z considered the Shanwei buoy and our radar Doppler winds.

2.2 00Z EC/JMA/UKMO suggested that the TC would land just to the west of Shangchuan at 09-12Z tmr, but NCEP changed its story and suggested the system to Zhuhai. 06Z JMA tuned its track N while the 06Z NCEP was put slightly to the S of its 00Z run. As actual movement of the system tracked slightly N’wards than the models’ f/c this afternoon, our working track was tuned N’wards and put to the N of the 5-model ensemble.

2.3 Base on the f/c track, gale radius would reach us after around midnight. Closet approach would be tmr around noon tmr at 110 km.

2.4 For the intensity f/c, models suggested reorganisation over N SCS and some intensification before landfall. However, models’ prog charts indicated min PP of 950-960hPa over SCS, and also in view of the analysed intensity of 105 kt was a bit slightly overestimated, the T+24 intensity was tuned down to 105 kt at 06Z with PP of 940 hPa.

2.5 00Z EPSgram tuned up the local winds strengthen b/w 00Z and 06Z tmr.

##### 3. Forecast issues

3.1 Storm surge run based on HKO 06Z track of Mangkhut indicated high water levels and SMS to potential flooding regions were issued.  3.5mCD (2m above normal water level) was mentioned in Pt II.

3.2 Two storm surge alternative scenarios were published on GOWISE, based on respectively HWRF 00z run using 930hPa and NCEP 00z run using 950hPa at closest approach.

3.3 Storm surge alert for Tai O should be issued 5 hour before water level reaching threshold (1615H tomorrow), please remember to issue the alert before noon tomorrow.

3.4 The max TT f/c was tuned up progressively to 31C based on the actual TT and those upstream to our N over SZ/inland GD. Even though the mean RH was considered marginally met for RFDW, due to the subsidence, but RFDW was withheld this afternoon in view of the evening TST/showers today.

##### 4. Alternative scenario

4.1 Latest run of HWRF indicated a more intense system with deeper PP would track towards Macau. In this case, local weather would be even worse than expected, especially the storm surge.

##### 5. Conference summary

5.1 Nil.

##### 6. Operational matters, party lines or reminders

<span style="color:red">6.1 T3 was issued at 1620H and remained in force.</span>

6.2 VHWW remained in force.

6.3 Fallen cargo case not closed.  Remember continue to issue the forecast form CFO-PM Appendix 10-3 0700H tomorrow.
