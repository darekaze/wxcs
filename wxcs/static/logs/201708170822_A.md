##### 1. Key observations

1.1 Sat imagery showed TC Hato moved steadily W’wards in N SCS. A satellite eye developed in the afternoon.

1.2 Radarscope depicted rainbands of evening TST sweeping our territory from N/NE in the afternoon. TST warning (issued at 1235H) was extended. Lightning was observed within our territory, and gusts over 90km/h were recorded at WGL. As the thundery showers gradually departed to our W, TST warning lapsed at 1845H.

1.3 Hato’s centre came within 512 km of the radarscope and RADOB was performed.  The eye became discernible in the latter part of the shift and the movement was generally westward near 12 kts with slight slowing in the early evening.  It started to gain some N’ly component towards the end of the shift.

1.4 Wind profiler showed mod to fresh E/NE’lies between 500 and 1500m, strong NE’lies between 1500 to 5000m.

1.5 Local surface winds were mod N’lies, while strong winds were observed on high grounds.

1.6 Visibility at HKO dropped to 5000m at 15H but increased after showers have affected our territory.

1.7 TT at HKO reached a historical record high of 36.6C at 1400H. The high temperatures around the territory were due to sig subsidence a/w Hato and the surface N’lies. Showers brought down the temperature to 28C at 17H. All ref stations recorded over 35.0C. HKHI at KP reached 31.9. Td lingered around 25.xC.

1.8 Dongsha buoy showed easterly winds of 19.3m/s at 14H (with pressure of 988.2hPa), when Hato passed about 0.7degree to the south of the buoy. This suggested that the TC was rather compact and the storm/hurricane radii were small.

1.9 An eye appeared on the satellite imageries in the afternoon. There was an intense hot tower w/ lightning activities a/w Hato. Hato was upgraded to T (65kts) at 16H which was supported by D’vorak. HKO D’vorak at 06Z gave FT = 4.0 (Vmax 60kts), 09Z gave FT = 4.5 (Vmax 72kts). BABJ upgraded Hato to T at 15H. D’vorak at 12Z gave FT 4.0. Hato’s intensity was kept at 65kts in view of the intense hot tower to Hato’s south and the improved eye visible on the radar imageries.

1.10 Lufeng oil rig recorded gale force winds towards the end of the shift, about 90 Nm away from the centre. Please consider tuning up the gale radius.

##### 2. Meso-scale analysis and local considerations

2.1 High temp triggered evening TST which were advected by the N/NE’lies from inland to us. Temperatures under r/f dropped to generally below 30C, so VHWW was cancelled at 18H.

2.2 SLOSH analyses were performed for both 06 and 09Z working track.  Sea levels at QUB, TPK, Tai O would reach 3.8m, 4.1m and 4.0m respectively in late morning tomorrow. Relevant alert messages have been issued. The alternative scenario using EC 00Z run which showed the southernmost track was also performed for internal reference.  It showed slightly lower sea levels than the working track.

##### 3. Forecast issues

3.1 The global model 00Z run tuned the track more to the south compared to the previous run. The ensemble track was based on the four-global models. The actual moved slightly slower than the ensemble track. Our working track was tuned more southwards and was placed between the 4-model ensemble and EC EPS ensemble mean.

3.2 Major models suggested that Hato would continue to intensity over N SCS before making landfall. Our assessment is that Hato would keep its intensity as T before making landfall, as the SST was over 30C but offset moderate VWS and proximity to landmass. Model prog charts suggested that the TC would weaken rapidly after making landfall. Hato was expected to weaken into a low by T+48.

3.3 Based on our working track and the 50% T-kidney, winds at offshore stations would start to reach F6 by midnight. Winds at offshore would reach F8 in the small hours. The Harbour would be within the kidney for F8 from 07H to 14H. Even if Hato takes a more westerly track than our working track, it would still cut the 50% gale T-kidney for the Harbour.

3.4 As the TC edges closer to our territory, with closest approach of about 65km to our SSW around 10H, local wx was expected to deteriorate sig, so heavy squally showers with TST were kept, supported by all available models in QPF summary table and EC EPS 75%-tile of 60mm.

3.5 Tmax of 30C was expected to occur overnight before local winds pick up. As heavy r/f was expected, Tmin of 26C was kept in the FLW. Timeseries also suggested that DV would be small, please consider using ‘temp will linger around xxC’ tmr morning in the FLW.

##### 4. Alternative scenario

4.1 If TC Hato took a westerly track, the impact on the local weather would be less severe, with weaker winds and lighter r/f. However, the latest obs suggested a movement with N’ly component, supported by ensemble members and global models.

##### 5. Conference summary

5.1 Nil.

##### 6. Operational matters, party lines or reminders

<span style="color:red">6.1 T3 was issued at 1820H to replace T1. T3 remained in force.</span>

6.2 VHWW was cancelled at 1800H.

6.3 TST warning was extended and allowed to lapsed at 1845H

6.4 Short-form request was received for MRCC SAR/039/2017 and handled. Stand down notice was received at 2025H.

6.5 MRCC Marine Pollution incident 068/2017 remained active.
